# Scripts

This repository will be mostly for scripts that I have used more than twice (I know, I just hate repeating things over and over again).

## Scripts definition

- `kali-setup.sh`: This script is used to setup zsh along with pentesting tools on a kali linux machine
- `oh-my-zsh-setup.sh`: To quickly setup oh-my-zsh with extensions that I like to use
- `debian-setup.sh`: My debian setup script

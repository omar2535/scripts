# Scripts

Just some scripts to make my life a bit easier since I can't seem to stick with one linux distro ðŸ˜….

## Scripts definition

- `kali-setup.sh`: This script is used to setup zsh along with pentesting tools on a kali linux machine
- `oh-my-zsh-setup.sh`: To quickly setup oh-my-zsh with extensions that I like to use
- `debian/debian-setup.sh`: My debian setup script
- `debian/update-script.sh`: Update script for non-debian packages
- `neovim/neovim-setup.sh`: Script to install and set up neovim

## Neovim

All my neovim configurations are in the neovim directory. Assumes you have a lot of things (IE. node, python, etc) installed on your system.
